            <p>hi, i'm kingston! this is my personal website.</p>
            <p>i create projects, research on certain topics, and write about them here.</p>
            <p>i've created <a href="https://anti-network.com" target="_blank">anti-network</a>, <a href="https://cli-mate.help" target="_blank">cli-mate.help</a>, and a domain i own but yet to publish, newclear.website</p>
            <p>i started all of my projects, research, and writings just recently. so all of them are still in the process of iteration.</p>
            <p>i'm writing this in html in r3f, once i get a hang of this,</p>
            <p>my projects will be better structured, and my research and writings will be published asap.</p>
        </Html>
